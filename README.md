**Problem**
Airborne pathogens pose a significant threat to public health, especially in high-density spaces such as hospitals, schools, and workplaces. Traditional air purification systems often rely on passive filtration, which is limited in detecting and neutralizing microscopic pathogens like viruses and bacteria. Furthermore, these systems may contribute to environmental harm through energy-intensive operations and non-biodegradable materials. The result is a growing need for more effective, sustainable air purification solutions that offer flexibility and adaptability to diverse environments.

**Our Product**
The PurEco air purifier is a universal, adaptable system designed to fit seamlessly into various environments, from residential homes to commercial buildings. The unit can function as a standalone device, similar to traditional plug-in air purifiers, or be integrated into central HVAC systems using specialized adapters—all within the same core unit.
